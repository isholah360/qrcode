# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Golf Portal Design

## Project Description
This project is a frontend design for a golf portal that is preparing for a tournament. The design includes a login and registration system, a floating "join now" advert banner, and other elements to enhance the user experience.

## Fonts and Styling
For this project, I chose Verdana, sans-serif, Alex Brush,Oswald ; because of its readability and clean design. The font is used consistently across paragraphs, headers, and other text elements to ensure a uniform appearance. The font size is chosen to be easily readable without overwhelming the design.

## Color Code
#6b860e;
#142127;
#f3f3f3
#808080
#e07135

## Animations and Transitions
To add a touch of dynamism, I used GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for animations and transitions. The animations are subtle yet add a lively feel to the design, enhancing user interaction.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **React**: The project is built using React for its component-based architecture and ease of use.
- **React Router Dom**: Used for implementing client-side routing and navigation.
- **React Slick**: Utilized for creating slides and carousels within the portal.
- **GSAP**: Applied for smooth animations and transitions across the design.
